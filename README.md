# Unity_SampleScriptableObjectSystem

Got inspire from the Unite talk from 2017 (yah, a bit old, I use the framework for couple years now) [Unite Austin 2017 - Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk), check the original githb repos of the talk here [Github](https://github.com/roboryantron/Unite2017).
